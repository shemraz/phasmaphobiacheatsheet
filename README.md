## Ghosts

### Spirit
- Smudging will stop it from hunting for 180 seconds (3 mins).
  - Smudge on low sanity then hide in a closet or locker for 3 minutes to confirm it's a Spirit.
  - Doesn't work every time, ghost can be lazy.

_If the ghost initiates a hunt before 180 seconds have elapsed since it was smudged, you can rule out Spirit._

### Wraith
- Can TP to within a 3m radius of a player anywhere on the map.
  - Produces EMF level 2 or 5 when it TP's.
  - If it TP's to you and starts a hunt, gtfo.
- Can't be tracked by footsteps.

_If the ghost does step in any salt piles, you can rule out Wraith._

### Phantom
- Can wander to the location of any random player anywhere on the map.
  - Produces EMF level 2 at the location where it ends its wander.
- Drains player sanity by 0.5% p/s if it has LoS when physically manifesting.
  - Radius of 10m.
- Phases out of visibility for intervals between 1 and 2 seconds during hunts.
  - Will disappear after taking its photo during scare events.
  - Ghost audio can still be heard, but not heartbeats and electronic equipment will stop malfunctioning.
  - Ghost photo will be clear with no distortion.

_If the ghost's physical manifestation remains after its photo is taken, or if it phases out of sight during hunts for intervals less than 1 second, you can rule out Phantom_

### Poltergeist 
- By scattering multiple objects in the investigation area, one can witness the ghost's throwing frequency.
    - Witnessing a throw every 0.5 seconds may indicate a Poltergeist. 
    - This strategy also helps in seeing if the ghost can make more powerful throws.
    - Sometimes many objects will launch at once.
- The activity level of a poltergeist is not a sure fire way to detect it, as sometimes other ghosts (oni, thay) may be more active, or the poltergeist may be randomly choosing not to interact much.

_If the ghost has not thrown an object every 0.5s (when it has had access to one) during a hunt, you can rule out poltergeist._

### Banshee
- Banshees scream even when its not a hunt.
- When in a D.O.T.S. state, the Banshee will try to move towards its hunt target instead of the nearest player.
- Try to quickly identify the target of the Banshee so as to both identify the ghost, and help get an edge in desicion making.
  - Banshees will look sanity of their target when attempting to start a hunt (if their target is within the investigation area), and will hunt when their sanity is below 50%
  - during a hunt if their target is inside of the investigation area they will not attack or kill (even on contact) other players.
  - just because you keep being the scare event target does not mean that you are the hunt target!

_If the ghost changes targets during a hunt when everyone is inside the investigation area, you can rule out Banshee._

### jinn
- The Jinn cannot turn off the fusebox, however it can turn on a light, which can then trip the fuse.
- The jinn will not interact with electronics more often than other ghosts.
- When the Jinn uses its ability there will be an EMF reading of 2/5 at the fusebox
  - Leave an EMF reader at the fuse box while the fuse box is on; if it picks up a reading but the fuse box never turned off, then it is very likely the Jinn using its ability.
- The Jinn will move faster when all of the following are true:
  - The fuse box is on.
  - The Jinn has Line-of-site with a player that its targeting.
  - The Jinn is further than 3m from that player.
- Wait for a hunt at the end of a long room or corridor, standing far away from where the ghost is expected to enter the room, and with line-of-sight all the way through. Listen for its footsteps and observe its speed before and after it sees the player. If it instantly gains speed to chase the player, then it is likely a Jinn; use Incense if needed. The Jinn will also slow down once it gets within 3 meters of its target.

_If the ghost is moving fast when it doesn't have line-of-site on a player, or if it turns off the fuse box, you can rule out Jinn._

### Mare
- Higher chance to turn off lights.
  - Cannot turn light switches on.
  - Has an ability to immediately turn off a light switch after a player turns it on.
- Higher chance to break bulbs durig scare events.
- Higher chance to roam from lit rooms to dark rooms.
- Can still hunt from lit rooms, but only if average sanity is before 40%.

_If the ghost initiates a hunt in a lit room or area when you are certain that average sanity is above 40% (best to use a candle for this) or if it ever turns a light switch on, you can rule out Mare._

### Revenant
- Can move at 3 m/s during hunts if it has LoS or knows the location of a player.
- Decreases to 1 m/s if player is out of LoS and the ghost doesn't know the location of the player.
  - Movement speed decreases by 0.75 m/s if LoS is broken.

_If the ghost does not dramatically speed up when sensing a player's location, or if does not move very slowly when it has no knowledge of any player's location, you can rule out Revenant._

### Shade
- Higher chance to manifest as a dark shadow during scare events.
- Chance to appear in shadow form if affected by music box/summoning circle.
- +2% chance to trigger scare event for each 1% of sanity lost.
  - 0% chance to scare at 100% average sanity.
  - 100% chance to scare at 0% average sanity.
- Will only hunt at 35% average sanity or lower.
- Will not initiate a hunt in the same room as a player.

_If you are certain that average sanity is at 100% and the ghost does a ghost event, or if you are certain that average sanity is above 35% and the ghost started a hunt, or even if it started a hunt at any sanity in the same room as any player, you can rule out Shade._

### Demon
- Ability gives a chance to hunt at 100% average sanity.
  - Otherwise hunts at 70% average sanity or lower.
- Hunts have a minimum cooldown of 20 seconds.
- Cannot hunt for 60 seconds after being smudged.
- Cannot hunt within 150% of the base radius of an active crucifix.

_If you are certain that average sanity is above 50% and no hunts are being initiated, or if you are certain that the ghost initiated a hunt just outside the base radius of a functioning crucifix but within the bonus 50% range, you can rule out Demon._

### Yurei
- When the yurei uses its ability sanity is decreased by 15%.
  - If the room has one or more open doors, it will fully close one door at random and produse an EMF level 2.
  - The Yurei cannot use its ability if its in a room with no door (lockers and closets do not count as doors, however tent and exit doors do).
- Keeping doors wide open near the ghost will help show when it uses its ability.
  - If the ghost shuts an exit door fully without a ghost event or hunt, then it is very likely a Yurei.
    - Note that The Mimic will leave Ultraviolet evidence on the exit door if it has been affected by the Yurei's ability, provided that type of evidence is not hidden.
  - If the ghost shuts any other door fully, then it is likely (but not definitely) a Yurei.

_If you insense a ghost and it walks through salt outside it's room less than 60s later, it cannot be a Yurei._

### Oni
- Higher chance to become more active with at least 1 player in the same room.
- Higher chance to show its physical form during a scare event.
- Can drain targeted player's sanity by 20% per scare event if player collides with the ghost.
- Cannot appear in mist form during scare events.
- Only phases out of visibility for a split second during hunts.

_If the ghost ever appears in mist form during ghost events or phases out of visibility during hunts like the average ghost, you can rule out Oni._

### Yokai

- Can hunt at 80% average sanity or lower if a player is speaking in its proximity.
- Higher chance to increase activity if players are talking in its proximity.
- During hunts, can only hear players talking and sense electronics within 2.5m radius.
- Has to be within 2.5m radius for music box to trigger a scare event and cursed hunt.

_If you are certain that average sanity is between 50-80% (best to use a candle for this) and relentless talking is not triggering any hunts, or if it repeatedly can sense your voice or your flashing electronics during hunts between 2.5 and 7.5 metres distance away, you can rule out Yokai._


### Hantu

- Freezing temps is mandatory in games with > 1 available evidence.
- Higher chance to turn off the fuse box.
  - Cannot turn fuse box on.
- Shows freezing breath during hunts if fuse box is off.
- Speed scales with room temperature from 1.4 m/s at 15°C to 2.7 m/s at 0°C or below.

_If there are no freezing temperatures in the ghost room, or if it gradually accelerates in speed with line-of-sight like the average ghost during hunts, you can rule out Hantu._

### Goryo

- Dots is mandatory in games with > 1 available evidence.
- Dots only visible by player who is not in the ghost room and is watching the camera.
- Cannot do long long roams and will never change ghost room.

_If you can see DOTS evidence without a video camera, or if the ghost ever clearly changes its ghost room, you can rule out Goryo._

### Myling
- Higher chance to be more vocal on the parabolic microphone.
- Cannot emit any audible sound from greater than 12m away during scare events or music box activation.

_If you are on the same floor as the ghost during the hunt and you can hear its voice and/or footsteps outside of the electronic disturbance radius, you can rule out Myling._
